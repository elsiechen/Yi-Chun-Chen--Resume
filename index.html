            <p>
                Self-learning coding since September 2020 when my second child was 11 months old and 
                being enthusiastic about coding through CS50's Introduction to Computer Science by HarvardX,
                which though is an entry-level course, I learned the elegance of programming, thinking algorithmically,
                and enhanced problem solving by scoring on 9 problem sets and a final project. The topic include 
                abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering,
                and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After finishing the introduction course, I dived more deeply into the web programming with 
                Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap through 
                CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript.Topics include database design, scalability, 
                security, and user experience. Through five hands-on projects and a final project, I learned writing and using 
                APIs, creating interactive UIs, version control tool like Github, and deployed projects in Heroku.
            </p>
            <p>
                To improve wev development ability, I am working on the online course of THE ODIN PROJECT, and learning 
                skills through building side projects. I am seeking chances to collaborate with other software engineers
                through internship program or volunteer job, and am open to entry-level position as a junior software engineer. 
                My children journey of first year taught me a lesson that human brain is elastic and it's never too late to pursue 
                the dream job.
